## Triad - JavaScript Mathematical Renderer
I recently came upon the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGS) and I knew that there was some way I could potentially help at least progress one of those goals. Of the 17 goals, the 4th goal: education; stook out to me. As a student in high school, it became obvious that what I put out could not be maintained and appended to each day; ergo no bootleg Khan Academy, etc... I do however know that even as a student in high school, I can put out quality. So, I decided that one way to help education, is to make tools that people can use to educate. Typically you would see mathematical animations rendered in Manim, a Python library, however I believe that people who do not know how to program, but want to make enticing math animations should have a tool to do so, which is why I made Triad. Triad is completely UI based.
